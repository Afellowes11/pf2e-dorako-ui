# pf2e Dorako UI
This is a UI overhaul for the Pathfinder 2nd Edition System for Foundry VTT.

The theme makes extensive use of `backdrop-filter` which is not supported in current versions of Firefox.

Eventually this will be a module, but for now it overwrites the current "Work in Progress" theme `color-scheme-ui.css` and as such can be selected via Game Settings -> PF2e Player Settings -> UI Theme -> Work in Progress.
